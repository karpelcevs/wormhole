### Claude Code

OpenCode is the source of truth, but it's possible to derive a user-level [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) setup from it.

```sh
./interlink-claude
```

This command
- generates Claude-native agents under `~/.claude/agents`
- links the canonical skills into `~/.claude/skills`
- adds a managed import block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

It owns only files recorded in `~/.claude/.interlink-claude-manifest` (existing Claude configuration is preserved, and name collisions fail without overwriting anything).
A symlinked `CLAUDE.md` is also left untouched and reported as a conflict.

Skill edits are reflected immediately through symlinks.
Run the command again after changing agents or moving the checkout.
Use `./interlink-claude --check` to report drift and conflicts without changing files.
Both modes list every translation with status indicators: `✅` in sync, `➕` missing or created, `🔄` content or link drift, `✨` updated, `🔗` relinked, `🗑️` stale, `⚠️` warning or configuration drift, and `❌` failure.

Agent translation preserves scalar `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` values for `edit`, `bash`, and `webfetch`.
Granular forms of those permissions are retained for OpenCode but cannot be enforced by the current Claude translator; translation emits a warning and relies on the generated agent prompt instead.
